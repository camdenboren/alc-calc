## Motivation

Weight-based measurement is growing in popularity for many in the kitchen, so why not apply this improved accuracy and consistency to making drinks?

The original project ([Alcohol_Weight_Calculator]) is a dead-simple Python CLI for quickly calculating the weight of ingredients in an alcoholic beverage. It has served me well, but it has notable limitations

- No input validation (shameful, I know)
- Inability to add non-alcoholic ingredients
- An emphasis on broadly categorizing ingredients handicaps precision when an ingredient's actual density is already known
- No GUI

The first three have relatively simple solutions that I could implement in a weekend, but the thought of retrofitting yet another Python GUI failed to excite me

Enter [GPUI], the UI Framework from the Zed team

- Tailwind's ease-of-use
- Rust's speed and safety
- First-class hardware acceleration

Rust rewrite with an undocumented framework it is :moyai:

## Structure

### Source

`src` contains two crates

- The binary crate (`main`) serves only as an entry point into the library crate, which contains the UI and calculation logic

- `ui` contains the main window, with individual views and components delegated to other modules like `dropdown`

### Build System

Cargo is the underlying build system, _but_ Nix is the 'meta' build system

For the uninitiated, Nix reproducibly supplies all project dependencies (including rust, Darwin SDKs, custom scripts, etc.) without the need for containers. From a practical standpoint, this means any Linux or macOS user can _reliably_ run this project with a single command

```shell
nix run github:camdenboren/alc-calc
```

The `build` and `format` scripts are very useful for any contributors (these aren't directly used in CI, but they smooth out the PR process)

You can access the development environment (including these scripts) with

```shell
nix develop github:camdenboren/alc-calc
```

Leverage the binary cache by adding [Garnix] to your nix-config

```nix
nix.settings.substituters = [ "https://cache.garnix.io" ];
nix.settings.trusted-public-keys = [ "cache.garnix.io:CTFPyKSLcx5RMJKfLo5EEPUObbA78b0YQ2DTCJXqr9g=" ];
```
